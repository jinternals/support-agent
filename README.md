# 🧑‍💼 Support Agent

> ⚠️ **Note:**This is subject to change as this is my learning project.


This is a demo application that showcases capabilities such as **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Tool Calling** using **Spring AI MCP (Model Control Plane)**.

## 📦 Modules

The application is divided into the following modules:

- [**support-agent-app**](support-agent-app)  
  Interacts with the LLM, MCP server, and vector store to perform intelligent support operations.

- [**support-agent-etl**](support-agent-etl)  
  Responsible for loading data into the vector store for RAG-based retrieval.

- [**support-mcp**](support-mcp)  
  MCP server that exposes support tools (e.g., for creating and managing tickets) to be invoked by the agent.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- ✅ Tool Invocation via MCP
- ✅ Modular Design for Clarity and Separation of Concerns

## 📡 Demo API Usage

Use the following sample requests to interact with the support agent.

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 🚀 Start database services

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

### 🔐 Set OpenAI API Key (for local LLM fallback or remote OpenAI access)

Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` if you're using Bash):

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key-here>
```

Then apply the changes:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
