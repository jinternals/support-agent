# 🧑‍💼 Support Agent

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository is subject to change as this is my learning project.


This is a demo application that showcases capabilities such as **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Tool Calling** using **Spring AI MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.

**Challenges with Large Language Models (LLMs)**

- Limited built-in knowledge
- No access to external data sources
- Restricted context window
- Potential for hallucination

**How We Overcome These Challenges**

By integrating RAG, MCP, and multi-step orchestration, we can enhance LLMs with real-time data access, richer context, and more reliable outputs.


---
## 📦 Modules

The application is divided into the following modules:

- [**support-agent-app**](support-agent-app)  
  Interacts with the LLM, MCP server, and vector store to perform intelligent support operations.

- [**support-agent-etl**](support-agent-etl)  
  Responsible for loading data into the vector store for RAG-based retrieval.

- [**support-mcp**](support-mcp)  
  MCP server that exposes support tools (e.g., for creating and managing tickets) to be invoked by the agent.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- ✅ Tool Invocation via MCP
- ✅ Modular Design for Clarity and Separation of Concerns

## 📡 Demo API Usage

Use the following sample requests to interact with the support agent.

<summary>🧾 Example: Ask a support question</summary>

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/ai/assistant/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "e85c20f0-ad28-4531-9ac4-158b9b4a3ece",
  "question": "I can’t log in even though my password and 2FA seem fine. Can you help?"
}
```

```json
{
  "answer": "I'm sorry to hear about the trouble you're having with logging in. \n\nFrom our knowledge base, here are some things you can do:\n\n1. Double-check your password and 2FA details. Sometimes, a minor typo can prevent you from logging in. You may refer to the article [Common Reasons for Login Failure](https://support.example.com/articles/login-troubleshooting) for more information.\n\n2. If you're locked out due to 2FA, you can contact support with ID verification to reset it. For more details, please see the article [Resetting 2FA When Locked Out](https://support.example.com/articles/reset-2fa).\n\n3. If you suspect an issue with your password, you can reset it by clicking 'Forgot Password' on the login screen and following the emailed instructions. Here is the article [How to Reset Your Password](https://support.example.com/articles/reset-password) for your reference.\n\nIf you have tried all these steps and still can't log in, I can help create a support ticket for you. Would you like me to do that?"
}

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 🚀 Start database services

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

### 🔐 Set OpenAI API Key: [This is only requred if LLM is OpenAI provided]

Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` if you're using Bash):

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key-here>
```

Then apply the changes:

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```
