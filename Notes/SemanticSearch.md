## Semantic Search and Embeddings

###  **Semantic search**
Semantic search refers to the process of retrieving information based on the meaning of
a query, rather than relying solely on keyword matching. Semantic search is the retrieval strategy.

### **Embeddings**
Embeddings are numerical representations of a text that capture semantic relationships, enabling 
algorithms to compare and match content based on similarity. Embeddings are the data format that 
makes semantic search efficient.
